# Quizlet Scraper and Flashcard Management Tool

Welcome to the repository for our Quizlet Scraper and Flashcard Management Tool. The current implementation is a Python script that takes a Quizlet URL as a parameter in the terminal, scrapes the flashcards from the set, and writes them to a text file.

We plan on adding a GUI to this initial project using PyQT5, and exploring other options for users to store and manage their flashcards, such as databases, Excel sheets, CSV files, and PDFs.

To use the tool, you will need to have the following Python packages installed: bs4, re, sys, and requests.

Our goal is to provide a convenient and user-friendly way for users to access and organize their flashcards from Quizlet, as well as the ability to add their own flashcard sets from various file types.

Thank you for your interest in our project.
