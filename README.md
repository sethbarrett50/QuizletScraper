# QuizletScraper
Current implementation is a python script taking a Quizlet Url as a parameter in terminal, which it scrapes and writes all flashcards to a text file. I plan on adding a GUI to this initial project using PyQT5, and potentially look into other options for users to store the flashcards(DB, excel, csv, pdf, etc). 
Current python packages needed: bs4, re, sys, requests
